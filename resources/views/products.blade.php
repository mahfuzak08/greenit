              <span class="product_name">POWER TRANSFORMER</span>
              <p>Transformers are one of the primary components for the transmission and distribution of electrical energy. The scope of transformer types starts with generator transformers and ends with distribution transformers. Transformers which are directly connected to the generator of the power stations are called generator transformers. Energypac’s standard range goes up to 520MVA and 400kV. The connection between the different high voltage system levels is made via network transformers. Energypac is able to offer network transformers up to 520MVA, 400kV.</p>

            <p>Transformers from 5kVA to 2500kVA and up to 36kV on the high voltage side and 3.6kV on the low voltage side are referred to as distribution transformers. In the last step, they distribute the electrical energy to the consumers by feeding from the high-voltage into the low-voltage distribution network. These are designed either as liquid-filled or as dry-type transformers. </p>
